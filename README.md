This is a VHDL register file generator written in Rust

Given a JSON input file containing a register dscritption, it can generate:

* A VHDL source file
* Markdown documentation
* Basic Linux C drivers
* Basic no-os C drivers

Right now this project is in a very unfinished state. There are still tons of 
features / improvements left to make if I ever find the time. For now, this 
works "well enough" to get a project up and running, but it still leaves a lot 
to be desired.
